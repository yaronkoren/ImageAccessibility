== Overview ==

Image Accessibility is an extension to MediaWiki that allows for defining
long descriptions of images on the wiki (especially complex images such as
diagrams), so that such images can be understood by visually impaired people,
presumably using screen reader software.

The "alt" attribute for images is not a suitable location for such
descriptions, since it is intended only for short summaries. Ironically,
neither is the "longdesc" attribute, which was intended for this purpose; it
was never well supported by browsers, and was deprecated in 2014.

Instead, this extension lets you place the description at a subpage (by
default, "/LongDescription") of the image's wiki page; and image that has
such a subpage defined for it will get a "View description of this image"
link placed below it, on whatever page(s) it is displayed on.
